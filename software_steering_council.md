# Software Steering Council

## Purpose

The Jupyter Software Steering Council (SSC) has jurisdiction over software-related decisions across Project Jupyter, with a primary focus on coordination across projects and decisions that have impact across many Jupyter Subprojects. It is also a mechanism for representatives of each project to share information and expertise. Technical decisions and processes where the SSC isn't explicitly involved are automatically delegated to the individual Subprojects so that they can manage their day-to-day activities, create new repositories in their orgs, etc., with independence and autonomy.

## Responsibilities

### Sole responsibilities

The SSC is responsible for the following:

- Defining the submission, review, and approval process for Jupyter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). JEPs are the mechanism for elevating any software decision/idea up to the broader Project, while individual Subprojects can make decisions within their scope via their regular mechanisms
- Stewarding the JEP process to ensure that it is inclusive and participatory, and solicits feedback from the right stakeholders. As a starting point, [the NumFOCUS DISCOVER Cookbook](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook) may offer some useful starting pointers.
- Making decisions on JEPs after receiving community feedback.
- Owning, managing and implementing the Jupyter Incubation process (https://github.com/jupyter-incubator).
- Owning, managing and implementing the Jupyter Attic process (https://github.com/jupyter-attic).
- Stewarding discussions and activities beyond JEPs that involve cross-cutting concerns, standards, protocols and other architectural issues that impact the entire project.
- Owning and managing anything related to security vulnerabilities across the project, including the Jupyter security reporting and discussion channels, any private security repositories, etc.

### Shared responsibilities with the Board of Directors

The SSC and Board of Directors (BoD) share the responsibility for:

- Changing the Jupyter Governance model.
- Creating new Jupyter Subprojects.
- Removing Subprojects from Jupyter.
- Designating working groups that have a non-software focus but have a representative in the SSC, such as the working group on Inclusive Community Development.

## Membership

SSC members are leaders from Jupyter Subprojects that wish to assist the community in sharing information across projects and participate in decision-making that affects many stakeholders in the Jupyter ecosystem. Membership requires active and ongoing participation in the project.

### Member composition

The Software Steering Council is composed of one representative from each of the Jupyter Subprojects. In addition, the SSC will contain members from certain working groups that have been created by the BoD and whose scope has important impact on SSC activities, such as Diversity and Inclusion, Accessibility, and Internationalization.

### Term length

There is no term length for SSC membership, as each Jupyter Subproject is in charge of selecting its own representative. Subprojects are encouraged to define their own expectations around SSC membership tenure, to share SSC membership responsibilities among core team members, and to provide mechanisms for healthy rotation that avoid burnout.

### Selecting SSC members

Each Jupyter Subproject or working group with SSC representation is responsible to nominate a single representative using the Jupyter Decision Making Guidelines.

### Bootstrapping the SSC

The initial Software Steering Council will be created with individuals nominated by each of the major Jupyter Subprojects, as defined by our [official list](list_of_subprojects.md). (what about the working groups?)

## Relationship with the Board of Directors

The SSC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities. It takes advising and guidance from the Board of Directors, but does not report to the BoD for any technical decisions. It also works with the Board of Directors to make any decisions that must be made jointly (e.g., changes to governance).
